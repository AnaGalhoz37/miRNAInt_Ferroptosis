# Multi-omics differential expression and integration analysis in Ferroptosis

## Description

In this repository is presented R scripts to reproduce the bioinformatic anaysis in manuscript [LINK when available]. 

In detail, here is reproduced the necessary steps to perform differential expression analysis of RNA-Seq data using the Bioconductor package [DESeq2](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) and integration analysis of miRNA, gene and proteomics data using [WPPI package](https://github.com/AnaGalhoz37/wppi) and miRNA target databases [mirTarBase](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab1079) and [TargetScan](10.1126/science.aav1741). 

## Usage 

In the `Data/` folder you can find output files from the differential expression analysis and multi-omics integration.
To access the raw and more details on the datasets, please check the manuscript.

This project was conducted in [R software](https://www.r-project.org). 

Bear in mind, here is only provided an adaptation of the original source code.
